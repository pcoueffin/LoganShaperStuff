I found a
[reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidWorks/comments/fyt9vq/im_in_an_intro_to_engineering_class_and_i_just/) where someone had been assigned to draw up
substantially the same tool using SolidWorks.

I've grabbed a local copy of the assignment page so that I have the
original drawing handy:

I'll probably strip out the metric v-threads in favour of some Acme
thread that I can find a tap and die for.  Finer thread is probably
better here.

I'm going to try adding a hex to the back of the main shaft, and to
the back of the tapered nut.  I can see value in being able to drive
these with a big wrench or an impact gun.  I have a set of Sherline
indexing collet blocks that should work for adding the hex part.  I'll
probably just leave the parts in the lathe chuck, attach the chuck to
the index block, and then use strap clamps and 1-2-3 blocks to hold it
to the shaper table.  Take light cuts so that the chuck does not
overtighten on the index block.
