# LoganShaperStuff

So I seem to have acquired a glorious piece of 1940's machining tech.  An 8" Logan Shaper.
Feel free to join my adventure tooling up this historic beast and figuring out how to make it do things it was never intended to do.

This is the best reference on the machine I've found so far.

A manual for its sister machine is available here, though I'll see if I can't scrounge soft-copy of something similar from my usual sources.

The actual manual for this machine came with it... So I'm going to scan it and put it online [here](https://pcoueffin.github.io/LoganShaperStuff/Manual).

# Projects

## Tooling

I can't really _make_ anything on the shaper without some basic tooling.

### T-Nuts

The first project I plan on trying with the machine is to make some longish bars of T-Nut material to fit the table.  Something I can drill, tap, and slice like salami to suit my fixturing needs.  I'll probably use cheap keystock from lordco, or maybe HRS from Princess Auto... whatever's cheap.

### Low Profile Vice
I'm thinking of fitting the table with a low-profile vice made by using the T-Nuts from the previous project to secure two 1-2-3 blocks to the table via the T-Slots as a fixed jaw.  I'll use some brass T-nuts to provide a sliding fit on another pair of blocks for the moving jaw, with screws extending through the T-slots (in tension) to pull them toward the fixed jaws.



### Finger Clamps

I've long wanted to make up some nice finger plates and clamps to secure "fiddly bits" for easier machining.  Something that can be used as an accessory with the 1-2-3 blocks would be cool.

### Bench blocks

I have some steel drops from when a friend worked in a shop with a bar-feeder.  One of them would be nice as a block with some v-grooves, and maybe a T-slot and some different sizes of holes for punches.  I think there was a Starrett one like that at one point.

### Surface Grinding Spindle

Is it possible to put a high-speed motor, and a custom floating spindle in place of the clapper?  If you true the wheel in place using the table traverse, will it grind true on objects that are mounted on the table?  I think I need to find out.

My first thought on this topic was to make a "tool" that consisted of a sanding block to hold swatches of wet/dry paper to put a fine finish on parts, and lap them to size... Then I got ambitious.  I'll probably try that first... then something using an RC plane motor and controller, throwing a relatively light-weight wheel.  I DGAF if it takes a long time to produce precise parts at fine feed... as long as they come out precise.

### Automated Z-axis feed

I got this idea from the South Bend "How to Run a Shaper" book.  Near the end of the book, they mentioned that you could blue up and mark out a complex shape on the face of a part, slap it in the vice, and do a series of roughing cuts in automatic feed to remove the bulk of the metal.  Then you set the machine to its finest feed and slowest speed, and hand-feed the z-axis up and down to cut down to the line in real time.

Looking at it, it would be relatively easy to fit a small stepper to the Z-handwheel, and either rig some sort of tracer, or a computer-controlled feed that can work from a G-Code like program.

### Mount for the Sherline lathe

I'd like to be able to bolt my Sherline lathe directly to the bed of the machine... This opens up some options for indexing parts, and adding keyways and flats, via very gentle cuts.

## Other obvious early projects

### Gear Puller.

I really want to build something as much like the ones we made in college in my Grandfather's unheated garage shop in the dead of winter using hacksaws and files.  Staying warm by working our asses off.  Journey in nostalgia really.  Might grind up form cutters for the curves, or free-hand the Z-axis... or auto feed.  There'll be some lathe work needed too.

### Knives

I'd want to use the shaper to cut fixtures to hold the blade at the right angle to grind in bevels.  Or just mount the blade horizontal, and use an automated Z-feed to get the angle right.

I can cut out the profiles using the automated Z-feed too... Grinding or lapping head to do all the filework and sharpening.

### Table Saw Cutters

I have a moulding head for the table saw.  I have several profiles of cutters for it.  Ideally, I'd like to have a blade like the one that Andy Klein invented for turning a piece of scrap ply into a drawer in 4 easy cuts.  I'd have to make 2 45 degree cuts, and one plunge cut into a piece of steel that can be hardened and tempered... then bevel and grind it.  If I drill the hole for fixturing it to the head first, I can use that hole, and a simple stop to fixture it for cutting the bevel.  I'm hoping the shaper can just cut HSS without me having to switch to abrasives.  Otherwise, I'll likely go high-carbon.
