The shaper is heavy.  About 700 pounds.  I'm not all that young anymore, and am pretty far from in good physical shape.  
To get this thing out of the back of a pickup, and standing on its own pedestal without breaking any parts or getting injured is 
likely to be an exercise in lifting with my brain instead of my back.

I have some tools for picking things up and putting them down available to me:

# Lifting Tools

## Engine-Hoist Arm

We used an Engine Hoist to get it off a dolly and onto the tailgate of the pickup in the first place. It might be useful to have 
one to pluck the tool out of the back of the pickup.

## Chain Hoist

My first thought was to back the pickup into the garage, and use the chain hoist (attached to a solid crossbar across several 
rafters...) to lift the shaper into the air by its ram.  
Then just lower it onto its pedestal gently.

Jim quickly pointed out that I can't easily do that without accounting for the canopy on his truck.  
I might be able to rig an external anchor and a snatch block to vector the forces, but I'm not sure what to anchor it to.

If I can get the shaper out of the back of his truck and onto some sort of platform in the garage, this might be a good 
option to revisit.

## Hydraulic Porta-Pack

The shaper is sitting on a piece of ply in the back of Jim's truck.  We pushed the plywood into the truck by setting a 4x4 post 
on the edge of the plywood (being careful not to let it hang down into the tailgate) and slowly backing up toward a handy 
telephone pole to push it in.  Normally I prefer to use a come-along and anchor to the loops in the front corners of the truck.

I think we can push the shaper, and the sheet of ply it is sitting on, out of the truck using one of the cylinders from the 
porta-pack.  Just set it against the back of the bed, and push the shaper out onto its waiting cradle, if I can get such a thing 
built easily.

## Pallet Jack

If I decide to use the engine-hoist setup... I'll probably mount the arm to a pallet, and stick some "heavy shit" (engine blocks, 
sacks of cement, etc) on the pallet to counterweight it.  The pallet jack can lift and move 5500 pounds, so that won't be an issue.

## Tools I don't think I'll use:

### I-Beam Trolley

This would be used to attach the chain hoist to a beam running the length of my shop.  Not really useful in this use-case.

## Swinging Arm Davit

If I can attach a heavy pipe floor-to-ceiling inside my garage in the corner, this should be able to swing outside, 
pick things up off a trailer, and set them in the shop.  Currently it sits in my shop and mocks me for my laziness.

## Bottle Jacks etc.

I have a number of other small jacks and such that I don't think will be pressed into service.


# Stuff I might acquire.

## Truck bed extender:

For 60 bucks, this might be the answer.

I can throw a jackstand under the end of it to support the weight.
And then I think I can slide the shaper out onto the extender, using
the portapack.  From there, I think it should be clear of the canopy,
so we can use the chain hoist to lift it clear.  I can think of other
uses for a setup like this.  Doubly so if I install a reciever on the
van.


# What we ended up doing...

So, _nothing_ ever goes to plan.

The truck bed extender was not available locally, and I did not have
time to order it online.

I built a couple of 3-legged sawhorses using Izzy Swan's plans, then
tied them together with a 2x6 so they could not easily tip over.
Cleared space in the garage just inside the door for the shaper where
I figured we could use the chain hoist to lift it off the
plywood... but I did not account for the fact that with the garage
door open, I can't reach the rafters above the door.  So I shuffled
the hell out of the garage to try to back the truck in far enough to
get past the door.  Turns out Jim's truck is too tall to go in my
garage...  So we backed the truck up to the door and used a tow-strap
and a snatchblock to lower it out of the truck.

Basically just turned crawled into the truck, and turned it so that
the base was facing out and slid it to the point where the weight was
mostly still in the pickup, because it is pretty seriously top-heavy.
Then ran a tow strap through the sling we still had around the ram,
and padlocked one end of the tow-strap to a ring built into the front
corner of the truck.  The sling acts as a snatch-block, so I have a
solid anchor, and two lines coming off the load.  Each line holds half
the weight of the shaper.  I sat in the back of the pickup, with the
free end of the tow-strap around my back and slowly paid it out one
inch at a time to lower to the ground.  Because the tow strap in the
sling was relatively high-friction, it acts as a brake, and the action
was really easy and smooth.  I am prettu sure I would have been able
to do this operation one-man if I really had to, though I'm glad to
have had a second person to make sure it was safe.  It would have been
nice to have a come-along or small winch on the payout side, but this
works surprisingly well.

Basicly, because I did not have the right gear set up at the time, I
was doing this technique to feed the tow strap under
control.

I'll try to draw up the anchoring better, and find reference diagrams
in Ashley's Book of Knots to explain the physics of why this is likely
to become part of my go-to toolkit for unloading heavy stuff from
vehicles.
