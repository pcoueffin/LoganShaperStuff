The shaper is heavy.  About 700 pounds.  I'm not all that young anymore, and am pretty far from in good physical shape.  
To get this thing out of the back of a pickup, and standing on its own pedestal without breaking any parts or getting injured is 
likely to be an exercise in lifting with my brain instead of my back.

I have some tools for picking things up and putting them down available to me:

# Lifting Tools

## Engine-Hoist Arm

We used an Engine Hoist to get it off a dolly and onto the tailgate of the pickup in the first place. It might be useful to have 
one to pluck the tool out of the back of the pickup.

## Chain Hoist

My first thought was to back the pickup into the garage, and use the chain hoist (attached to a solid crossbar across several 
rafters...) to lift the shaper into the air by its ram.  
Then just lower it onto its pedestal gently.

Jim quickly pointed out that I can't easily do that without accounting for the canopy on his truck.  
I might be able to rig an external anchor and a snatch block to vector the forces, but I'm not sure what to anchor it to.

If I can get the shaper out of the back of his truck and onto some sort of platform in the garage, this might be a good 
option to revisit.

## Hydraulic Porta-Pack

The shaper is sitting on a piece of ply in the back of Jim's truck.  We pushed the plywood into the truck by setting a 4x4 post 
on the edge of the plywood (being careful not to let it hang down into the tailgate) and slowly backing up toward a handy 
telephone pole to push it in.  Normally I prefer to use a come-along and anchor to the loops in the front corners of the truck.

I think we can push the shaper, and the sheet of ply it is sitting on, out of the truck using one of the cylinders from the 
porta-pack.  Just set it against the back of the bed, and push the shaper out onto its waiting cradle, if I can get such a thing 
built easily.

## Pallet Jack

If I decide to use the engine-hoist setup... I'll probably mount the arm to a pallet, and stick some "heavy shit" (engine blocks, 
sacks of cement, etc) on the pallet to counterweight it.  The pallet jack can lift and move 5500 pounds, so that won't be an issue.

## Tools I don't think I'll use:

### I-Beam Trolley

This would be used to attach the chain hoist to a beam running the length of my shop.  Not really useful in this use-case.

## Swinging Arm Davit

If I can attach a heavy pipe floor-to-ceiling inside my garage in the corner, this should be able to swing outside, 
pick things up off a trailer, and set them in the shop.  Currently it sits in my shop and mocks me for my laziness.

## Bottle Jacks etc.

I have a number of other small jacks and such that I don't think will be pressed into service.


# Stuff I might acquire.

## Truck bed extender:

For 60 bucks, this might be the answer.

I can throw a jackstand under the end of it to support the weight.   And then I think I can slide the shaper out onto the
extender, using the portapack.  From there, I think it should be clear of the canopy, so we can use the chain hoist to lift it clear.
I can think of other uses for a setup like this.  Doubly so if I install a reciever on the van.
